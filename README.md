# Tetris

This is just a toy project for me to learn about SFML. I don't recommend anyone use this for playing tetris, and there are plenty of better guides to SFML.

Please don't use this to judge my software development skills, this was not a serious project and much of the code is lifted from elsewhere. 

I did particularly enjoy working on the piece rotation system, and incorporating some classic scoring metrics.
 
I'm making it public in case anyone finds a snippet that they can use.
